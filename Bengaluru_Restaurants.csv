Nandhini Restaurant Jayanagar,Indian        ,"The Andhra Culinary Tradition The celebrated Andhra Cuisine is a product of many rich influences like the glorious history and culture of its zestful and vigorous land. It has its roots in the Southern cooking tradition with each of Andhra Pradesh’s three regions namely-the Coast, Rayalseema and the Telangana having their own distinctive cooking styles. The Nawabs brought with them the Deccani style of cooking which drew influences from the Mughlai cuisine. As time passed the two cooking traditions influenced each other leading to the culmination of the Andhra fare as we know it today. While the fiery chillies and peppers and the staple use of rice in the cuisine can be attributed to the original Southern style of cooking, the dollops of ghee, use of fresh fruits instead of dried ones and the non-vegetarian specialities are all typical Nawabi traits. All in all there is no dearth of variety for foodies as far as Andhra cuisine is concerned. Whether it’s the traditional Andhra meal served on a plantain leaf with the quintessentially spicy & tangy vegetable sambhars, gravies, Avakkai, Gongura pickles and chutneys to be relished with rice, or the mouthwatering array of biriyanis, top of the list being the Hyderabadi Biriyani, the kebabs, kormas, khichris or kulchas Andhra cuisine is a lip-smacking treat all the way.","108 30th Cross Road, Minerva Circle,, 560004",+91 80 4341 1111,3.5

In 2012, Monkey Bar kick-started India’s gastropub revolution. Now we’re back to create more Monkey madness. Our newly imagined gastropub of today promises a delicious culinary adventure (don’t worry, our beloved burgers are still on the menu), great cocktails and everything else that makes for a fun time out. In our menu, you’ll find regional food from India sitting pretty next to favourites from across the world; and street food from ‘patli gullies’ holding their own against culinary gems discovered down narrow lanes across the planet. Our drinks menu is inspired by popular Indian bevs, indigenous flavours and a strong zero waste philosophy. Featuring peru and chilli chaat, murabba, sharbat, cutting chai, queen pineapple, fruit leathers, and salts, our new bar menu is a standing ovation to all things cocktail. #GoBananas","No.1, The Museum, Museum Road,, 560001",+91 86554 64500,5.0

Paris Panini - Gourmet Sandwiches & Wraps,French Cafe Fast Food European Street Food    ,"Paris Panini brings you the best of french-style sandwiches in India. Born in France, Nicolas moved to India after years of experience with French cuisine. Missing his sandwiches back home he decided to experiment, and soon after started a food truck (under the name Le Casse Croute) aiming to bring gourmet french street food to Bangalore. His vision was pretty simple, serve homemade, high-quality street food using premium ingredients from across India and Europe following traditional French recipes. After rebranding to Paris Panini in 2019, Nicolas, AB and Nikhil kept the same values and worked on a more elaborate menu to give you the most authentic experience as if you were seating in a Parisian cafe.","35, 4th B Cross Rd, 5th Block,, 560095",+91 77604 52288,
